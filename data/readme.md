## The LTNs Encoding of the Visual Relationship Dataset
[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1km5OcWoibwDneBO09cZfLhX2B0xuYjCJ) you can find the LTNs encoding of the Visual Relationship Dataset. The dataset is already divided into the `train` and `test` folder and each folder contains the encoding for LTNs of the VRD images and their annotations. The `sg_test_images` folder contains the 1000 raw images of the VRD test set and the `ontology` folder contains the adopted logical constraints.
